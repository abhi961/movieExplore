A simple and responsive React Native Movie App built using TypeScript. The app features a Movie List screen that fetches and displays a list of movies using a fake API. Users can view detailed information about each movie on the Details screen and have the ability to add or remove movies from their Favourites. The favourite list is managed using Redux Toolkit for efficient state management.

Key Screens & Features:

MovieList Screen: Displays a scrollable list of movies with poster, title, and rating.

Details Screen: Shows detailed information about the selected movie.

Add to Favourite: Allows users to add movies or remove from  favourite.

State Management: Handled via Redux Toolkit.
redux-persist using for store data locally in application when we close the application and open the data still there in apps.

Navigation: Implemented using React Navigation.

package like : LinearGradient,react-redux, redux/toolkit,react-navigation/native-stack.

API: https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started.

Design: design 

A fully custom-designed React Native Movie App with intuitive UI and smooth navigation. The app includes a Movie List, Movie Details, and a Favourite feature — all styled with a self-made, unique UI (no third-party UI kits used).

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
